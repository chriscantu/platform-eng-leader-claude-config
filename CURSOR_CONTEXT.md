# Cursor Context: SuperClaude Framework Integration

This file provides context for Cursor IDE to understand and utilize the SuperClaude strategic framework.

## Framework Files to Reference

When working in this directory, reference these framework files for context:

### Core Framework
- `CLAUDE.md` - UI Foundation context and strategic priorities
- `PERSONAS.md` - Strategic leadership persona system (12 personas)
- `COMMANDS.md` - Strategic command framework and workflows
- `FLAGS.md` - Director-level flags and auto-activation logic
- `PRINCIPLES.md` - Core philosophy and decision frameworks

### Enhanced Capabilities
- `MEMORY.md` - Strategic memory system architecture
- `ENHANCED-COMMANDS.md` - Tool integration for strategic intelligence
- `COST-OPTIMIZATION.md` - Cost management and selective activation

## Strategic Context for Development

When writing code or providing technical guidance, consider:

### Platform Leadership Context
- Role: Director of Engineering, UI Foundation
- Organization: Web platform, design system, internationalization, UI service shell
- Focus: Strategic platform leadership, VP/SLT communication, cross-team coordination

### Development Philosophy
- Platform-first decisions (organizational leverage over individual contribution)
- Evidence-based proposals with quantifiable metrics
- Cross-functional impact consideration (Product/Design/Marketing/Legal)
- Strategic architecture balancing stability vs innovation vs market responsiveness

### Code Quality Standards
- Apply first principles thinking to technical problems
- Consider organizational leverage and platform reusability
- Design for cross-team autonomy and minimal dependencies
- Build systems that scale beyond direct involvement

## Active Persona Context

Based on the current task context, activate appropriate strategic guidance:

- **Technical Architecture** → martin persona: Platform architecture, evolutionary design, technical debt strategy
- **Security/Compliance** → security + elena personas: Platform security architecture, accessibility compliance
- **Performance/Analytics** → data persona: Analytics strategy, metrics frameworks, data-driven decisions
- **Cross-Team Integration** → diego + rachel personas: Engineering leadership, cross-functional alignment

## Memory System Integration

This project includes a strategic memory system (`memory/` directory) with:
- Executive sessions and meeting outcomes
- Strategic initiatives and business value tracking
- Platform intelligence and adoption metrics
- Cross-session context and pattern recognition

Consider how code changes relate to strategic memory capture and business intelligence.
