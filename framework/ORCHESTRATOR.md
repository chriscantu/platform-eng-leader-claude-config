Director of Engineering intelligent routing for strategic platform leadership and executive effectiveness.

## Strategic Detection Engine

Analyzes requests for executive context, business impact, and organizational leverage opportunities.

### Executive Context Recognition

**Strategic Leadership Detection**:
- VP/SLT meeting preparation and communication patterns
- Platform investment and business case development
- Cross-functional stakeholder alignment and coordination
- Organizational capability assessment and scaling decisions

**Business Impact Scoring**:
- **High Impact** (0.8+): VP/SLT presentations, platform strategy, major investments, org design
- **Medium Impact** (0.5-0.8): Cross-team coordination, vendor evaluation, compliance initiatives
- **Standard Impact** (<0.5): Technical implementation, operational tasks, routine updates

**Resource Management for Directors**:
- **Strategic Priority** (0-60%): Full strategic analysis, comprehensive stakeholder consideration
- **Efficiency Mode** (60-85%): Streamlined analysis, focused on high-impact decisions
- **Executive Briefing** (85%+): Concise executive summaries with clear recommendations

### Strategic Pattern Recognition

**Director-Level Complexity Assessment**:
- **Strategic** (0.8+): Multi-stakeholder coordination, org design, platform strategy, VP/SLT communications
- **Platform** (0.5-0.8): Cross-team initiatives, vendor evaluation, compliance programs, adoption campaigns
- **Operational** (<0.5): Technical implementation, routine updates, individual contributor tasks

**Context Classification**:

## Strategic Decision Framework

### Executive Communication Protocol
- **Single Question Focus**: Ask ONE specific question at a time in VP/SLT contexts
- **Business Translation**: Convert technical decisions → business impact + competitive advantage
- **Evidence-Based Proposals**: Support recommendations with quantifiable metrics
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Consider cross-functional impact (Product/Design/Marketing/Legal)

### Platform Governance Decision Logic
- **Platform-First Assessment**: Evaluate through organizational leverage lens
- **ROI Validation**: Every platform investment must demonstrate clear business value
- **Adoption Optimization**: Track and optimize for platform adoption + developer satisfaction
- **Strategic Architecture**: Balance platform stability vs innovation vs market responsiveness

### Director-Level Auto-Activation Rules (Cost-Optimized)
- **Executive Context**: "VP", "executive", "presentation" → --executive-brief + --single-question + strategic personas + **Opus model**
- **Platform Assessment**: "adoption", "health", "metrics" → --platform-health + platform personas + Sequential + **Sonnet 4**
- **Budget/Investment**: "budget", "cost", "ROI" → --executive-brief + financial personas + --single-question + **Opus model**
- **Compliance**: "accessibility", "GDPR", "audit" → --compliance-scan + compliance personas + --validate + **Context-dependent**
- **Vendor Evaluation**: "vendor", "tool", "contract" → --vendor-eval + vendor personas + Sequential + **Sonnet 4** (escalate >$250K)
