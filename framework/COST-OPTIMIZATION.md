# COST-OPTIMIZATION.md - Strategic Tool Cost Management

Intelligent cost optimization system for Claude Flow MCP tool integration while preserving SuperClaude's 60-70% cost savings.

## Cost Optimization Philosophy

### **Core Principles**
- **Strategic Value First**: Tools activate only when strategic value exceeds cost
- **Executive Priority**: Always activate for VP/SLT contexts regardless of cost
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reuse insights across similar strategic contexts
- **Selective Enhancement**: Enhance high-value commands, preserve optimization
- **ROI Measurement**: Track cost per strategic insight and business outcome

### **Cost Optimization Targets**
```yaml
Baseline SuperClaude: 60-70% cost savings through model routing
Tool Integration Impact: Maximum 25% increase in token usage
Net Cost Optimization: Maintain 45-55% savings vs. baseline AI costs
Strategic Value ROI: Minimum 10:1 return on incremental tool costs
```

## Selective Activation Framework

### **Activation Priority Matrix**
```yaml
Tier 1 - Always Activate (Executive Priority):
  context_triggers:
    - VP/SLT meeting preparation and strategic presentations
    - Investment decisions >$100K with board impact
    - Crisis management and incident response coordination
    - Strategic planning with organizational impact >20 people

  tools_activated: ["performance_report", "trend_analysis", "cost_analysis"]
  cost_justification: "Executive context overrides cost considerations"
  expected_roi: "20:1+ through improved decision quality and stakeholder satisfaction"

Tier 2 - Context Dependent Activation (Strategic Value Threshold):
  context_triggers:
    - Platform assessment with adoption issues or health concerns
    - Cross-team coordination with >3 dependency conflicts
    - Budget planning with >10% variance or complex ROI modeling
    - Compliance/audit with elevated risk levels (Yellow/Red)

  activation_threshold: strategic_value_score > 0.7 AND cost_benefit_ratio > 3:1
  tools_activated: Context-specific subset based on value analysis
  cost_justification: "Strategic value exceeds cost with measurable ROI"

Tier 3 - Selective Activation (Cost-Benefit Analysis):
  context_triggers:
    - Routine organizational assessment without specific issues
    - Standard stakeholder coordination without major conflicts
    - Regular budget review without variance concerns
    - Operational meetings without strategic implications

  activation_threshold: strategic_value_score > 0.8 AND cost_benefit_ratio > 5:1
  tools_activated: Single highest-value tool only
  cost_justification: "High value threshold ensures positive ROI"
```

### **Cost-Benefit Calculation Engine**
```yaml
Strategic Value Scoring (0.0 - 1.0):
  executive_context: 0.4 weight
    - VP/SLT preparation: 1.0
    - Board presentation: 1.0
    - Strategic planning: 0.9
    - Cross-functional coordination: 0.7
    - Routine assessment: 0.3

  business_impact: 0.3 weight
    - >$1M decisions: 1.0
    - >$500K decisions: 0.8
    - >$100K decisions: 0.6
    - Organizational change >50 people: 0.8
    - Platform adoption issues: 0.7

  urgency_factor: 0.2 weight
    - Crisis/incident response: 1.0
    - Weekly SLT reporting: 0.8
    - Monthly planning: 0.6
    - Quarterly review: 0.5
    - Ad hoc analysis: 0.3

  complexity_requirement: 0.1 weight
    - Multi-stakeholder coordination: 0.9
    - Cross-team dependency resolution: 0.8
    - Financial modeling requirements: 0.7
    - Trend analysis needs: 0.6
    - Simple metrics: 0.3

Cost-Benefit Ratio Calculation:
  expected_value = strategic_value_score × estimated_business_impact
  tool_cost = estimated_token_usage × token_cost_rate
  cost_benefit_ratio = expected_value / tool_cost
```

## Intelligent Caching Strategy

### **Context-Aware Caching**
```yaml
Cache Categories:
  Executive Preparation Cache (24-hour TTL):
    - Stakeholder profiles and communication preferences
    - Recent organizational health metrics and trends

  Strategic Analysis Cache (48-hour TTL):
    - Market trend analysis and competitive intelligence
    - ROI models and financial projections for similar investments
    - Cross-team coordination patterns and success strategies
    - Risk assessment frameworks and mitigation strategies

  Organizational Intelligence Cache (72-hour TTL):
    - Team performance baselines and benchmarks
    - Platform health metrics and correlation patterns
    - Bottleneck analysis and resolution effectiveness
    - Stakeholder influence mapping and decision patterns

Cache Hit Optimization:
  context_similarity_threshold: 0.8 (80% context overlap)
  cache_value_decay: Linear decay over TTL period
  cache_invalidation: Automatic on significant context changes
  cache_warming: Pre-populate for scheduled executive meetings
```

### **Batch Processing Optimization**
```yaml

    - Single tool activation cost with dual value delivery

  Cost + Trend Analysis:
    - Combine for investment decisions requiring market intelligence
    - Financial modeling enhanced with competitive positioning
    - Reduced redundant market data processing
    - Comprehensive business case generation efficiency

  Task Orchestration + Bottleneck Analysis:
    - Combine for complex cross-team coordination initiatives
    - Workflow optimization with constraint identification
    - Integrated dependency mapping and resolution planning
    - Enhanced coordination strategy with systematic optimization
```

## Token Usage Monitoring and Optimization

### **Real-Time Cost Tracking**
