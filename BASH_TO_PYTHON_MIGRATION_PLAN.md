## Current State Analysis

### Scripts Requiring Migration

| Script | Complexity | Risk Level | Migration Priority |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| `extract-l2-strategic-initiatives.sh` | High | Critical | P0 - **Immediate** |
| `extract-current-initiatives.sh` | High | High | P1 - Week 1 |
| `generate-weekly-report-claude.sh` | Very High | High | P1 - Week 2 |
| `generate-monthly-report-claude.sh` | Very High | Medium | P2 - Week 3 |
| `setup.sh` | Medium | Low | P3 - Week 4 |
| `sync-claude-config.sh` | Low | Low | P3 - Week 4 |
| `setup-jira-token.sh` | Low | Low | P3 - Week 4 |

### Key Technical Challenges

1. **JSON Parsing Complexity**:
   - Multi-level nested JSON processing
   - Field extraction with null handling
   - Complex filtering and transformation logic

2. **API Integration Reliability**:
   - Jira API authentication and rate limiting
   - Network timeout and retry handling
   - Response validation and error recovery

3. **Report Generation Logic**:
   - Dynamic content generation based on data
   - Template processing and variable substitution
   - Multi-format output (Markdown, JSON, etc.)

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Environment variable handling
   - Secret management and rotation
   - Multi-environment configuration
