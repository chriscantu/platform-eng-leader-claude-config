## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Python 3.8+ for memory management
- SQLite3 for strategic memory persistence
- Git for version control

### Installation Options

Choose between **Directory-Based** (recommended) or **Global Configuration** setup:

#### Option A: Directory-Based Installation (Recommended)

**Benefits**: Self-contained, portable, no global system changes, easy to version control

1. **Clone and Initialize**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/platform-eng-leader-claude-config.git
   cd platform-eng-leader-claude-config
   ```

2. **Set up Strategic Memory System**
   ```bash
   # Initialize SQLite database
   sqlite3 memory/strategic_memory.db < memory/schema.sql

   # Verify database setup
   python3 memory/memory_manager.py --status
   ```

3. **Use Claude Code from This Directory**
   ```bash
   # All SuperClaude functionality works from this directory
   # The framework files (CLAUDE.md, PERSONAS.md, etc.) are automatically loaded

   # Test the framework
   claude --help

   # Start using strategic commands immediately
   ```

4. **Configure Memory-Enhanced Commands** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Make memory commands executable
   chmod +x commands/memory-enhanced-commands.sh

   # For convenience, add to PATH (optional)
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/commands"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

#### Option B: Global Configuration Installation

**Benefits**: Available from any directory, integrates with existing Claude Code setup

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/platform-eng-leader-claude-config.git
   cd platform-eng-leader-claude-config
   ```

2. **Copy to Global Claude Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create global directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ~/.claude

   # Copy framework files to global location
   cp CLAUDE.md COMMANDS.md PERSONAS.md FLAGS.md RULES.md PRINCIPLES.md MCP.md ORCHESTRATOR.md MODES.md MODEL-SELECTION.md ~/.claude/

   # Copy enhanced framework files
   cp MEMORY.md ENHANCED-COMMANDS.md COST-OPTIMIZATION.md STRATEGIC-TOOLS.md ~/.claude/
   ```

3. **Set up Strategic Memory System**
   ```bash
   # Keep memory system in project directory
   sqlite3 memory/strategic_memory.db < memory/schema.sql
   python3 memory/memory_manager.py --status

   # Or set up globally
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/memory
   cp memory/* ~/.claude/memory/
   cd ~/.claude/memory && sqlite3 strategic_memory.db < schema.sql
   ```

### Which Option Should You Choose?

| Feature | Directory-Based | Global Configuration |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple - just clone | ⚠️ Requires copying files |
| **Portability** | ✅ Self-contained | ❌ Tied to machine |
| **Version Control** | ✅ Everything tracked | ⚠️ Manual sync needed |
| **Multiple Projects** | ⚠️ Need separate directories | ✅ Available everywhere |
| **Updates** | ✅ `git pull` to update | ⚠️ Manual file copying |
| **Team Sharing** | ✅ Share via git repo | ❌ Individual setup required |
| **Isolation** | ✅ No system changes | ⚠️ Modifies global config |

**Recommendation**: Use **Directory-Based** (Option A) unless you specifically need the framework available from any directory on your system.

### How It Works

#### Directory-Based Framework Loading

Claude Code automatically loads configuration files from the current directory in this order:

1. **Current Directory**: `./CLAUDE.md` (highest priority)
2. **Global Configuration**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (fallback)

When you run Claude Code from the SuperClaude directory, it automatically:
- Loads all 12 strategic personas from `PERSONAS.md`
- Activates the strategic command system from `COMMANDS.md`
- Applies Director-level flags and optimization from `FLAGS.md`
- Uses the enhanced memory system and tool integration

**No additional configuration needed** - just `cd` into the directory and start using strategic commands!

### Usage

#### Core SuperClaude Commands

Strategic commands with auto-persona activation:

```bash
# Platform assessment with analytics
/assess-org platform --platform-health

# Investment business case development
/justify-investment platform-modernization --executive-brief

# Cross-team stakeholder alignment
/align-stakeholders design-system-v3 --stakeholder-align

# VP/SLT presentation preparation
/prepare-slt "Platform Strategy Update" --executive-brief
```

#### Enhanced Commands with Strategic Tools

When high strategic value is detected, tools activate automatically:

```bash
# Executive preparation with performance analytics
/assess-org --analytics-enhanced --memory-enabled

# Investment analysis with financial modeling
/justify-investment --financial-modeling --competitive-intel

# Stakeholder coordination with workflow intelligence
/align-stakeholders --coordination-intel --dependency-mapping

# Executive briefing with strategic intelligence
/prepare-slt --executive-intelligence --competitive-intel
```

#### Memory-Enhanced VP Preparation

```bash
# Prepare for VP Engineering meeting
./commands/memory-enhanced-commands.sh prep_vp_meeting "vp_engineering" "quarterly_planning"

# Store meeting outcome for future context
./commands/memory-enhanced-commands.sh store_meeting_outcome "session_id" "successful" "Platform initiatives approved"
```

## Strategic Features
