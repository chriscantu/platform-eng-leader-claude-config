## Initiative Status Dashboard

### ðŸ”´ At Risk Initiatives

{{jira-issues:url=https://company.atlassian.net|jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND status = "At Risk"|columns=key,summary,assignee,priority,updated|title=false}}

**Immediate Actions Required**:
- Daily standups for blocked initiatives
- Executive escalation for resource conflicts
- Risk mitigation plan execution

### ðŸŸ¡ Attention Needed (Stale >14 Days)

{{jira-issues:url=https://company.atlassian.net|jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND status in (New, Committed) AND updated < -14d ORDER BY updated ASC|columns=key,summary,assignee,priority,updated|title=false}}

**Recommended Actions**:
- Status review and planning sessions
- Resource allocation assessment
- Timeline validation and adjustment

### ðŸŸ¢ On Track Initiatives

{{jira-issues:url=https://company.atlassian.net|jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND status = "In Progress" AND updated > -7d ORDER BY priority DESC|columns=key,summary,assignee,priority,updated|title=false}}

### ðŸš€ Priority Focus: Migration Initiatives

{{jira-issues:url=https://company.atlassian.net|jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND summary ~ "Migration OR \"New Relic\"" AND status not in (Done, Closed, Completed)|columns=key,summary,status,assignee,updated|title=false}}

## Strategic Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Patterns

{{chart:type=bar|jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND priority = Critical|groupBy=status|title=Critical Priority Initiative Status}}

**Risk Indicators**:
- **Critical Stalled**: {{jira-issue-count:jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND priority = Critical AND status != "In Progress"}} critical initiatives not in active progress
- **Long Stale**: {{jira-issue-count:jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND updated < -21d}} initiatives inactive >3 weeks
- **Migration Dependencies**: {{jira-issue-count:jql=project = PI AND assignee in (user1@company.com, user2@company.com) AND summary ~ "Migration"}} migration initiatives requiring coordination

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Immediate (24-48 hours)
- Daily check-ins for all "At Risk" initiatives
- Resource reallocation for critical blocked items
- Escalation to VP Engineering for persistent blockers

#### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Cross-team coordination for migration initiatives
- Resource capacity rebalancing
- Timeline adjustment for realistic delivery

#### Long-term (1 month+)
- Platform capability investments to reduce complexity
- Process improvements for initiative tracking
- Stakeholder communication optimization
